# RecAD

RecAD is a free access Android application, which is available in Play Store platform, developed to record, save, and process audio files taken from patients to evaluate either the patient presents Alzheimer disease or not using Hidden Markov's models.
The application has been designed for my Bachelor Thesis in Biomedical Engineering at CEU San Pablo University. 

The project is currently in progress.
