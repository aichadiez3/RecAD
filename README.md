# RecAD

RecAD is a free access Android application, which is available in Play Store platform, developed to record, save, and process audio files taken from patients to evaluate either the patient presents Alzheimer disease or not using Hidden Markov's models.
The application has been designed for my Bachelor Thesis in Biomedical Engineering at CEU San Pablo University. 

The project is currently in progress.

## PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

For the correct operation of the program, it is necessary to have covered a series of requirements, both hardware and software.

The minimum _software_ requirements would be as follows:
-	Download RecAD application from Play Store
- Android operating system (version 11.0 or higher)

The minimum _hardware_ requirements would be as follows:
- Working device speaker
- Microphone

## PROGRAM PERMISSIONS

The first execution of the program asks for allowing permission for accessing the microphone and internal storage.

A problem may occur when the permission to local storage stays blocked. Solve this problem by:

- Go to App info
- Permissions
- *Storage* permission may be set as _NOT ALLOWED_. Set it then as _ALLOWED_ + _Allow management of all files_
